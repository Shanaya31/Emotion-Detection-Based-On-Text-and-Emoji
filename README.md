# Emotion-Detection-Based-On-Text-and-Emoji

## Problem Statement:
In the realm of opinion mining, an area of increasing importance, we tackle the challenge of extracting insights 
from the vast content on social media platforms to support decision-making. The sheer volume of online 
information necessitates automation for efficient analysis. Understanding emotions in text is crucial, as manual 
analysis is time-consuming and prone to interpretation errors. Emojis, often used to convey emotions, add 
complexity due to their context-dependent nature. Our research proposes an innovative emotion detection 
model that combines text and emoji data, enhancing accuracy in emotion recognition. This adaptable model 
finds applications in sentiment analysis, feedback assessment, mental health monitoring, and user-centric 
contexts, offering valuable insights for improved digital communication and meeting evolving user and 
organizational needs.

## Objectives of the Project:

 • Develop an Innovative Emotion Detection Model	
  • Analyzing the feedback
 • Obtaining an emotion based on the analysis
 • Creation of Annotated Dataset
 • Effective Preprocessing
 • Evaluating Model Efficacy
 • High Accuracy Implementation
 • Enhancing Digital Communication
